First, if you have an image relevant to your notebook, such as a [logo](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/doc/source/_static/numpylogo.svg), link to this image at the top of the notebook. The following Markdown example illustrates the correct technique for linking such an image:\n",

Adding this tag improves accessibility and allows more people to properly access your notebook.\n",

This header will be automatically used by the Pythia book-building process to generate the page title, which will then be added to the navbar, table of contents, etc. As such, the header needs to be short, concise, and descriptive. After the header line, add a separate Jupyter Notebook cell with the text `---`. This adds a separating line used to separate the title from the overview and prerequisites. This technique will also be used later to separate other sections."

Each concept or package listed must link to a Pythia Foundations tutorial, or to a relevant external resource. To build the prerequisite table, first copy the following Markdown table into your notebook. You must then edit the table to contain your notebook prerequisites. Each row must contain the name of the concept, along with a link to the tutorial, either on Pythia Foundations or a relevant external resource. It must also be noted whether the concept is helpful or necessary.\n",

Also, please note that overestimates are better than underestimates.\n",
