Python and Jupyter are cool technologies, but they only scratch the surface of why you might want to adopt Python for your geoscience workflow.

This section will introduce GitHub, the de facto standard platform for collaboration and version control used by the open-source Python community.
including how to open a GitHub issue and Pull Request.

We will walk users through things like

- registering for a free GitHub account
- How (and why) to open an issue on GitHub
- The need for version control
- Basic use of git for version control
- What's a Pull Request, and how do you open one?
