We will walk users through things like

- What are GitHub repositories, and what are some Python-specific examples?
- Registering for a free GitHub account
- How (and why) to open an issue on GitHub
- Cloning and pulling; what's the difference?
- What is a git *branch*?
- Don't be reluctant to contribute to a project!
- What's a Pull Request, and how do you open one?
- The need for version control
- Basic use of git for version control
