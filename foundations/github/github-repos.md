## What is a GitHub repository?

GitHub gives the following explanation of a [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world):

> A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a `README` file, a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

In short, it is a collection of files. Each GitHub repository has an owner, which could be an individual or an organization. Repositories can also be set to public or private, determining who can see and interact with it. While a repository can simply store files, GitHub is designed with collaboration in mind. Within a repository, anyone can use the Issues feature to report a bug, plan improvements, or provide feedback to others working on the repository. The Discussions feature can be used for ideas or other conversations that are not as specific or actionable as an Issue. Finally, there is the Pull request. We will go into the specifics later, but a Pull request allows a user to propose a change to any of the files within a repository.

Check out GitHub's ["Create a repo"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) tutorial to learn how to create your own repository!

## What are some examples of repositories?

All of the Python packages covered in this Foundations book have associated GitHub repositories (e.g. [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray)), as well as [Python itself](https://github.com/python/cpython). As you can see by the recent timestamps, these repositories are actively changing, and this reflects the adaptability of the [open-source software](https://opensource.org/osd) ecosystem surrounding Python.

Then there is the [Pythia Foundations repository](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations) on which this tutorial is stored. It is owned by the [Project Pythia organization](https://github.com/ProjectPythia), which also owns several other repositories that store the files needed to generate https://projectpythia.org/, among other things.
