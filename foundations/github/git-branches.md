## Overview of GitHub branches

The best practices for a simple workflow for sugesting changes to a GitHub repository are: create your own fork of the repository, make a branch from your fork where your changes are made, and then suggest these changes move to the upstream repository with a pull request. This section of the GitHub chapter assumes you have read all prior GitHub sections, are familiar with git commands and the vocabulary ("cloning," "forking," "merging," "pull request" etc),  and that you have already created your own fork of the (GitHub Sandbox Repository)[https://github.com/ProjectPythia/github-sandbox] hosted by Project Pythia. That fork is where you will make your first GitHub branch.

### What are Git branches?

Git branches allow for non-linear or differing revision histories of a repository. At a point in time, you can split your repository into multiple development paths (branches) where you can make different commits in each, typically with the ultimate intention of merging these branches and development changes together at a later time. 

One rule of thumb is for each development feature to have its own development branch until that feature is ready to be added to the upstream codebase. This allows you to compartmentalize your pull requests so that smaller working changes can be merged upstream independently of one another. For example, you might have a complete or near-complete feature on its own branch with an open pull request awaiting review. While you wait for feedback from the team before merging it, you can still work on a second feature on a second branch without affecting your first feature's pull request. **We encourage you to always do your work in a designated branch.**
