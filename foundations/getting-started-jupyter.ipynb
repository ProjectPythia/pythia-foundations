Jupyter consists of four main components: Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter Kernels, Jupyter Lab, and Jupyter Hub. Jupyter can be executed locally and remotely.\n",

Jupyter Notebooks contain executable code, LaTeX equations, visualizations (e.g., plots, pictures), and narrative text. The code does not have to just be Python, other languages such as Julia or R are supported as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are celebrated for their interactive output that allows movement between code, code output, explanations, and more code - similar to how scientists think and solve problems. Jupyter Notebooks can be thought of as a living, runnable publication and make for a great presentation platform."
