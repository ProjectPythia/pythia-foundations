    "### Markdown Cells\n",
    "Markdown is a convenient way to create formatted text using a simple syntax. There are different flavors of markdown, but the [basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) are supported across the board and generally cover 80% of the use cases. HTML is also valid in markdown cells. In fact, all of the text and the header of this notebook are markdown/HTML. With markdown you can create headings, embed images, link to other pages, create lists, and more. We aren't going to exhaustively cover markdown, but the essentials can help you make really nice notebooks. Remember, the better your documentation, the more you'll thank yourself later. Think of the notebook as a lab notebook.\n",
