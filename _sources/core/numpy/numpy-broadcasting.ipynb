This information can be helpful and very powerful, but we also suggest moving on to take a look at some of the label-based corners of the Python ecosystem, namely [Pandas](../pandas) and [Xarray](../xarray) for the ways that they make some of these concepts simpler or easier to use for real-world data.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "We've previewed some advanced NumPy capabilities with a focus on _vectorization_, or using clever broadcasting and windows of our data to enhance the speed and readability of our calculations. Doing so can reduce explicit construction of loops in your code and keep calculations running quickly!\n",

    "### What's next\n",
    "This is an advanced NumPy topic, and important to designing your own calculations in a way for them to be as scalable and quick as possible. Please check out some of the following links to explore this topic further. We also suggest diving into label-based indexing and subsetting with [Pandas](../pandas) and [Xarray](../xarray), where some of this broadcasting can be simplified or have added context."
