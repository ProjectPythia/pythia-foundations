The explanation is as follows: `hist1` is a tuple returned by `hist2d`, and `hist1[3]` contains a `matplotlib.collections.QuadMesh` that points to the colormap for the first histogram. To make sure that both histograms are using the same colormap with the same range of values, `vmax` is set to 0.18 for both plots. This ensures that both histograms are using colormaps that represent values from 0 (the default for histograms) to 0.18. Because the same data values are used for both plots, it doesn't matter whether we pass in `hist1[3]` or `hist2[3]` to `fig.colorbar`.\n",

    "In addition, there are many other types of plots that can also share colorbars. An actual use case that is quite common is to use shared colorbars to compare data between filled contour plots. The `vmin` and `vmax` keyword arguments behave the same way for `contourf` as they do for `hist2d`. However, there is a potential downside to using the `vmin` and `vmax` kwargs. When plotting two different datasets, the dataset with the smaller range of values won't show the full range of colors, even though the colormaps are the same. Thus, it can potentially matter which output from `contourf` is used to make a colorbar.

    "### The `Normalize` Class\n",
    "Notice that both of these examples contain plotting functions that make use of the `norm` kwarg.  This keyword argument takes an object of the `Normalize` class.  A `Normalize` object is constructed with two numeric values, representing the start and end of the data.  It then linearly normalizes the data in that range into an interval of [0,1]. If this sounds familiar, it is because this functionality was used in a previous histogram example.  Feel free to review any previous examples if you need a refresher on particular topics. In this example, the values of the `vmin` and `vmax` kwargs used in `hist2d` are reused as arguments to the `Normalize` class constructor.  This sets the values of `vmin` and `vmax` as the starting and ending data values for our `Normalize` object, which is passed to the `norm` kwarg of `hist2d` to normalize the data. There are many different options for normalizing data, and it is important to explicitly specify how you want your data normalized, especially when making a custom colormap.\n",

    "## Mosaic Subplots\n",
    "One of the helpful features recently added to Matplotlib is the `subplot_mosaic` method.  This method allows you to specify the structure of your figure using specially formatted strings, and will generate subplots automatically based on that structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted two plots on top, and one on the bottom, we can construct them by passing the following string to `subplot_mosaic`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\n",
    "AB\n",
    "CC\n",
    "\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates three `Axes` objects corresponding to three subplots.  The subplots `A` and `B` are on top of the subplot `C`, and the `C` subplot spans the combined width of `A` and `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we create the subplots, we can access them using the dictionary returned by `subplot_mosaic`.  You can specify an `Axes` object (in this example, `your_axis`) in the dictionary (in this example, `axes_dict`) by using the syntax `axes_dict['your_axis']`. A full example of `subplot_mosaic` is as follows:"
