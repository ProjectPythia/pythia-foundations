This site is built with [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org).

A full contributor's guide will appear here, cross-referencing our tutorials on open Pull Requests on GitHub.

Basic instructions on how to build the JupyterBook locally can be found on the README page of the book's [source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations).
