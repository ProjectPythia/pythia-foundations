# How to Contribute

```{note}

This site is built with [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org).

A full contributor's guide will appear here, cross-referencing our tutorials on open Pull Requests on GitHub.

A simple way to comment on anything you find in this book is to use the "open issue" and "suggest edit" buttons under the GitHub Octocat logo at the top of each page. These links will take you to GitHub where the source material for the book is hosted. You'll need a free (and broadly useful) GitHub account.

If you'd like to contribute a Jupyter Notebook to these materials, please reference our [template](template) viewable on the next page. This template is available to you in `preamble/template.ipynb` if you've cloned the repository, or available as a download [directly from GitHub](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations/raw/main/preamble/template.ipynb).

Basic instructions on how to build the JupyterBook locally can be found on the README page of the book's [source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations).
