Computers do not inherently know human representations of time; as such, they store time as a large binary number, indicating a number of time units after a set date and time.  This is much easier for a computer to keep track of.  In the case of Unix time, the time unit is seconds, and the set date and time is the epoch.  Therefore, Unix time is the number of seconds since the epoch.  The epoch is defined as January 1, 1970 00:00 [UTC](#What-is-UTC?).  This is quite confusing for humans, but again, computers store time in a way that makes sense for them.

Core date and time libraries in various programming languages, including Python, inevitably have design flaws, relating to time zones, date and time formatting, and other inherently complex issues.  Third-party libraries are often created to fix the limitations of the core libraries, but this approach is frequently unsuccessful. To avoid time-zone-related issues, it is best to handle data in UTC; if data cannot be handled in UTC, efforts should be made to consistently use the same time zone for all data.  However, this is not always possible; events such as severe weather are expected to be reported in a local time zone, which is not always consistent.\n",

Despite the name of this method, the newly created object is time zone naive.  Therefore, we must invoke the object's [replace()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.replace) method and specify UTC with a `tzinfo` object in order to make the object time zone aware. As described above, we can use the `pytz` module's timezone() method to create a new `tzinfo` object, again using the time zone string 'US/Mountain' (US Mountain Time Zone). To convert the datetime object `utc` from UTC to Mountain Time, we can then run the [astimezone()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.astimezone) method."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Standard Library contains several modules for dealing with date and time data. We saw how we can avoid some name ambiguities by aliasing the module names; this can be done with import statements like `import datetime as dt` and `import time as tm`. The `tm.time()` method just returns the current [Unix time](#What-is-Unix-Time?) in seconds -- which can be useful for measuring elapsed time, but not all that useful for working with geophysical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `datetime` module contains various classes for storing, converting, comparing, and formatting date and time data on the Gregorian calendar. We saw how we can parse data files with date and time strings into `dt.datetime` objects using the `dt.datetime.strptime()` method. We also saw how to perform arithmetic using date and time data; this uses the `dt.timedelta` class to represent intervals of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we looked at using the third-party [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) module to handle time zone awareness and conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In subsequent tutorials, we will dig deeper into different time and date formats, and discuss how they are handled by important Python modules such as Numpy, Pandas, and Xarray."
