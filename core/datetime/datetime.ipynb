    "Time is an essential component of nearly all geoscience data. Timescales span orders of magnitude from microseconds for lightning, hours for a supercell thunderstorm, days for a global weather model, millenia and beyond for the earth's climate. To properly analyze geoscience data, you must have a firm understanding of how to handle time in Python. \n",

    "The [lunar day](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/tides/media/supp_tide05.html) is 24 hours, 50 minutes with two low tides and two high tides in that time duration. If we know the time of the current high tide, we can easily calculate the occurrence of the next low and high tides with the `timedelta` class. (In reality, the *exact time* of tides is influenced by local coastal effects, in addition to the laws of celestial mechanics, but we will ignore that fact for this exercise.)\n",

    "The `timedelta` class is initialized by supplying time duration usually supplied with [keyword arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument) to clearly express the length of time.

    "## Dealing with Time Zones\n",
    "\n",
    "Time zones can be a source of confusion and frustration in geoscientific data and in computer programming in general. Core date and time libraries in various programming languages inevitably have design flaws (Python is no different) leading to third-party libraries that attempt to fix the core library limitations. To avoid these issues, it is best to handle data in UTC, or at the very least operate in a consistent time zone, but that is not always possible. Users will expect their tornado alerts in local time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is UTC?\n",
    "\n",
    "[UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) is an abbreviation of Coordinated Universal Time and is equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), in practice. (Greenwich at 0 degrees longitude, is a district of London, England.) In geoscientific data, times are often in UTC though you should always verify this assumption is actually true!\n",

    "### Time Zone Naive Versus Time Zone Aware `datetime` Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create `datetime` objects in Python, they are so-called \"naive\" which means they are time zone unaware. In many situations, you can happily go forward without this detail getting in the way of your work. As the [Python documentation states](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html): \"Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with, at the cost of ignoring some aspects of reality\". \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you wish to convey time zone information, you will have to make your `datetime` objects time zone aware. In order to handle time zones in Python, you will need the third-party [pytz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz) module whose classes build upon, or \"inherit\" in OO terminology, from the `tzinfo` class. You cannot solely rely on the Python Standard Library unfortunately. \n",

We then create a \"US/Mountain\" `tzinfo` object as before, but this time we will use the [astimzone()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.astimezone) method to adjust the time to the specified time zone."

    "\n",
    "The Python Standard Library (included with every Python distribution) contains several modules for dealing with date and time data. We saw how we can avoid some name ambiguities by aliasing the module names with `import datetime as dt, time as tm`. The `tm.time()` method just returns the current [Unix time](#What-is-Unix-Time?) in seconds -- which can be useful for measuring elapsed time, but not all that useful for working with geophysical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `datetime` module contains various classes for storing, converting, comparing, and formatting date and time data. Importantly, we saw how we can do arithmetic on time and date data, making use of the `dt.timedelta` class to represent intervals of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we looked at using the third-party [pytz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz) module to handle timezone awareness and conversions.\n",
