This section contains tutorials on dealing with times and calendars in scientific Python, beginning with use of the [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) standard library.

When this chapter is fully built out, it will include a comprehensive guide to different time libraries and when/where to use them, including

- [Numpy `datetime64`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.datetime.html) for efficient vectorized datetime operations
- [cftime library](https://unidata.github.io/cftime/) for dealing with non-standard calendars

These will be cross-referenced with tutorials on dealing with timeseries data in [Pandas](pandas) and [Xarray](xarray).
