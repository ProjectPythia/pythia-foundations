This section will contain tutorials on basic plotting with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).

From the [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org) "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python."

Matplotlib is the go-to library for plotting within python, with numerous packages and libraries using matplotlib as a base to build off of. If you were to learn a single plotting tool to keep in your toolbox, this is the package.

The key feature to matplotlib is its extensibility and the [extensive documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) available to the community.

Currently, we provide a basic introduction to matplotlib, but at a later date, we will add:

- Legend and annotation customization
- Customizing layouts
- Interactive and 3D plotting
