The next set of examples demonstrates this and provides a general overview of plotting with Xarray.\n",

    "Xarray expands on Pandas' labeled-data functionality, bringing the usefulness of labeled data operations to N-dimensional data. As such, it has become a central workhorse in the geoscience community for the analysis of gridded datasets. Xarray allows us to open self-describing NetCDF files and make full use of the coordinate axes, labels, units, and other metadata. By making use of labeled coordinates, our code is often easier to write, easier to read, and more robust.\n",
