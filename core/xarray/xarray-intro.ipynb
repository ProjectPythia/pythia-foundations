    "Xarray brings the joy of Pandas-style labeled data operations to N-dimensional data. As such, it has become a central workhorse in the geoscience community for the analysis of gridded datasets. Xarray allows us to open self-describing NetCDF files and make full use of the coordinate axes, labels, units, and other metadata. By making use of labeled coordinates, our code is often easier to write, easier to read, and more robust.\n",
