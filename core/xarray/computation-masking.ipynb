    "While we can obtain useful summaries of datasets using simple aggregation methods, it is more often the case that aggregation must be performed over coordinate labels or groups. In order to perform this type of aggregation, it is helpful to use the **split-apply-combine** workflow.

    "Those familiar with Boolean conditions know that such conditions can be combined by using logical operators. In the case of `.where()`, the relevant logical operators are bitwise or exclusive `'and'` (represented by the `&` symbol) and bitwise or exclusive 'or' (represented by the `|` symbol). This allows multiple masking conditions to be specified in a single use of `.where()`; however, be aware that if multiple conditions are specified in this way, each simple Boolean condition must be enclosed in parentheses. (If you are not familiar with Boolean conditions, or this section is confusing in any way, please review a detailed Boolean expression guide before continuing with the tutorial.) In this example, we provide multiple conditions to `.where()` using a more complex Boolean condition. This allows us to mask locations with temperature values less than 25, as well as locations with temperature values greater than 30. (As stated above, the Boolean condition matches values to keep, and everything else is masked out. Because we are now using more complex Boolean conditions, understanding the following example may be difficult. Please review a Boolean condition guide if needed.)"
