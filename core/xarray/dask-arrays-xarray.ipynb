    "# Dask Arrays with Xarray\n",
    "\n",
    "The scientific Python package known as Dask provides Dask Arrays: parallel, larger-than-memory, n-dimensional arrays that make use of blocked algorithms. They are analogous to Numpy arrays, but are distributed. These terms are defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Parallel** code uses many or all of the cores on the computer running the code.\n",
    "*  **Larger-than-memory** refers to algorithms that break up data arrays into small pieces, operate on these pieces in an optimized fashion, and stream data from a storage device. This allows a user or programmer to work with datasets of a size larger than the available memory.\n",
    "*  A **blocked algorithm** speeds up large computations by converting them into a series of smaller computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we cover the use of Xarray to wrap Dask arrays. By using Dask arrays instead of Numpy arrays in Xarray data objects, it becomes possible to execute analysis code in parallel with much less code and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn the distinction between *eager* and *lazy* execution, and performing both types of execution with Xarray\n",
    "- Understand key features of Dask Arrays\n",
    "- Learn to perform operations with Dask Arrays in similar ways to performing operations with NumPy arrays\n",
    "- Understand the use of Xarray `DataArrays` and `Datasets` as \"Dask collections\", and the use of top-level Dask functions such as `dask.visualize()` on such collections\n",
    "- Understand the ability to use Dask transparently in all built-in Xarray operations\n",

    "## Blocked algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, the definition of \"blocked algorithm\" is an algorithm that replaces a large operation with many small operations. In the case of datasets, this means that a blocked algorithm separates a dataset into chunks, and performs an operation on each.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how blocked algorithms work, consider a dataset containing a billion numbers, and assume that the sum of the numbers is needed. Using a non-blocked algorithm, all of the numbers are added in one operation, which is extremely inefficient. However, by using a blocked algorithm, the dataset is broken into chunks. (For the purposes of this example, assume that 1,000 chunks are created, with 1,000,000 numbers each.) The sum of the numbers in each chunk is taken, most likely in parallel, and then each of those sums are summed to obtain the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using blocked algorithms, we achieve the result, in this case one sum of one billion numbers, through the results of many smaller operations, in this case one thousand sums of one million numbers each. (Also note that each of the one thousand sums must then be summed, making the total number of sums 1,001.) This allows for a much greater degree of parallelism, potentially speeding up the code execution dramatically."

    "### `dask.array` contains these algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The main object type used in Dask is `dask.array`, which implements a subset of the `ndarray` (NumPy array) interface. However, unlike `ndarray`, `dask.array` uses blocked algorithms, which break up the array into smaller arrays, as described above. This allows for the execution of computations on arrays larger than memory, by using parallelism to divide the computation among multiple cores. Dask manages and coordinates blocked algorithms for any given computation by using Dask graphs, which lay out in detail the steps Dask takes to solve a problem. In addition, `dask.array` objects, known as Dask Arrays, are **lazy**; in other words, any computation performed on them is delayed until a specific method is called."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covered the use of Xarray to access Dask Arrays, and the use of the `chunks` keyword argument to open datasets with Dask data instead of NumPy data. Another important concept introduced in this tutorial is the usage of Xarray `Datasets` and `DataArrays` as Dask collections, allowing Xarray objects to be manipulated in a similar manner to Dask Arrays. Finally, the concepts of larger-than-memory datasets, lazy computation, and parallel computation, and how they relate to Xarray and Dask, were covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dask Shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Dask Arrays and NumPy arrays are generally interchangeable, NumPy offers some functionality that is lacking in Dask Arrays. The usage of Dask Array comes with the following relevant issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Operations where the resulting shape depends on the array values can produce erratic behavior, or fail altogether, when used on a Dask Array. If the operation succeeds, the resulting Dask Array will have unknown chunk sizes, which can cause other sections of code to fail.\n",
    "2.  Operations that are by nature difficult to parallelize or less useful on very large datasets, such as `sort`, are not included in the Dask Array interface. Some of these operations have supported versions that are inherently more intuitive to parallelize, such as [`topk`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.topk.html).\n",
    "3.  Development of new Dask functionality is only initiated when such functionality is required; therefore, some lesser-used NumPy functions, such as `np.sometrue`, are not yet implemented in Dask. However, many of these functions can be added as community contributions, or have already been added in this manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn More\n",
    "\n",
