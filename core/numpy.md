From the [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html):

> NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, and much more.

NumPy's position at the center of the scientific Python ecosystem means that all users should start here in their learning journey through the core scientific packages.

In [NumPy Basics](numpy-basics), you will learn to create, perform basic operations on, and index and slice NumPy arrays.

[Intermediate NumPy](intermediate-numpy) covers additional concepts related to indexing and slicing arrays,
and [NumPy Broadcasting](numpy-broadcasting) introduces the way NumPy treats arithmetic on arrays of different
shapes, which can help make your code more efficient by avoiding loops.
