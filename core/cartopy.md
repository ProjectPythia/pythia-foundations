From the [Cartopy website](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest):
Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to
produce maps and other geospatial data analyses.

Cartopy makes use of the powerful PROJ.4, NumPy and Shapely libraries and includes a programmatic interface
built on top of Matplotlib for the creation of publication quality maps.

You should have a basic familiarity with Matplotlib prior to working through the Cartopy notebooks presented here.

Key features of cartopy are its object-oriented [projection definitions](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/crs/projections.html#cartopy-projections),
and its ability to transform points, lines, vectors, polygons and images between those projections.
