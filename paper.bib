Research cyberinfrastructure (CI) is a key catalyst for discovery and innovation and plays a critical role in ensuring U.S. leadership in science and engineering, economic competitiveness, and national security, consistent with NSF's mission. Funding of a set of awards through the ACCESS program has established a suite of CI coordination services targeted at supporting a broad and diverse set of requirements, researchers, and usage modalities spanning all areas of science and engineering research and education complemented by support for the collective and coordinated operation of the overall ACCESS program.},

@inproceedings{hancock_jetstream2_2021,
	abstract = {Jetstream2 will be a category I production cloud resource that is part of the National Science Foundation's Innovative HPC Program. The project's aim is to accelerate science and engineering by providing ``on-demand'' programmable infrastructure built around a core system at Indiana University and four regional sites. Jetstream2 is an evolution of the Jetstream platform, which functions primarily as an Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud. The lessons learned in cloud architecture, distributed storage, and container orchestration have inspired changes in both hardware and software for Jetstream2. These lessons have wide implications as institutions converge HPC and cloud technology while building on prior work when deploying their own cloud environments. Jetstream2's next-generation hardware, robust open-source software, and enhanced virtualization will provide a significant platform to further cloud adoption within the US research and education communities.},

@misc{jupyterbook_2020,
	abstract = {{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Jupyter Book{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material. Here are some of the features of Jupyter Book: ✔ Write publication-quality content in Markdown. You can write in either Jupyter Markdown, or an extended flavor of Markdown with publishing features. This includes support for rich syntax such as citations and cross-references, math and equations, and figures. ✔ Write content in Jupyter Notebook. This allows you to include your code and outputs in your book. You can also write notebooks entirely in Markdown that get executed when you build your book. ✔ Execute and cache your book's content. For {\textless}code{\textgreater}.ipynb{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and Markdown notebooks, execute code and insert the latest outputs into your book. In addition, cache and re-use outputs to be used later. ✔ Insert notebook outputs into your content. Generate outputs as you build your documentation, and insert them in-line with your content across pages. ✔ Add interactivity to your book. You can toggle cell visibility, include interactive outputs from Jupyter, and connect with online services like Binder. ✔ Generate a variety of outputs. This includes single- and multi-page websites, as well as PDF outputs. ✔ Build books with a simple command-line interface. You can quickly generate your books with one command, like so: {\textless}code{\textgreater}jupyter-book build mybook/{\textless}/code{\textgreater}},

LROSE, Py-ART, pyrad, BAL- TRAD, wradlib) and how they connect with the scientific software stack. The course will be built with Jupyter Notebooks as hands-on approach for interactive user experi- ence. The main course programming language is Python, but also Command Line Tools are used. The course will also highlight the "xradar" package, implementing the newly adopted FM301/CfRadial2 WMO standard, as well as the gpm-api software, which facilitates the download and analysis of TRMM PR and GPM DPR spaceborne radars data. These two tools will be used to showcase how to harness the power of xarray and dask for efficient, distributed radar data processing. The course will cover operational use (e.g. in HPC environments or Cloud Infrastructure) as well as algorithm development, enabling the participants to implement their own algorithms. The course will also show how to create workflows for different aspects of weather radar data processing, using open datasets relevant to the attendees and ERAD 2024},

	abstract = {Jupyter Notebooks have been widely adopted by many different communities, both in science and industry. They support the creation of literate programming documents that combine code, text, and execution results with visualizations and all sorts of rich media. The self-documenting aspects and the ability to reproduce results have been touted as significant benefits of notebooks. At the same time, there has been growing criticism that the way notebooks are being used leads to unexpected behavior, encourage poor coding practices, and that their results can be hard to reproduce. To understand good and bad practices used in the development of real notebooks, we studied 1.4 million notebooks from GitHub. We present a detailed analysis of their characteristics that impact reproducibility. We also propose a set of best practices that can improve the rate of reproducibility and discuss open challenges that require further research and development.},

@article{wilkinson_fair_2016,

A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},
