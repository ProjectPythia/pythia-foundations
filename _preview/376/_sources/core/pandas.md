From the [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) "is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language."

Pandas is a very powerful library for working with tabular data (i.e. anything you might put in a spreadsheet -- a common data type in the geosciences). It allows us to use labels for our data so that we can write expressive and robust code to manipulate the data.

Key features of Pandas are the ability to read in tabular data, slice and dice data, and exploratory analysis tools native to the library.
