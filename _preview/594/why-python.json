The advantage of high-level languages is that they provide built-in functions, data structures, and other utilities that are commonly used, which means it takes less code to get real work done. The disadvantage of high-level languages is that they tend to obscure the low-level considerations such as memory use, how many floating-point operations are happening, and other information related to performance.
