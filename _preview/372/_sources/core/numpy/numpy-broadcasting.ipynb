    "Before we begin, it is important to know that broadcasting is a valuable part of the power that NumPy provides. However, there's no looking past the fact that broadcasting can be conceptually difficult to digest. This information can be helpful and very powerful, but it may be more prudent to first start learning the other label-based elements of the Python ecosystem, [Pandas](../pandas) and [Xarray](../xarray).  This can make understanding NumPy broadcasting easier or simpler when using real-world data. When you are ready to learn about NumPy broadcasting, this section is organized as follows:\n",

The last item in the strides tuple simply states that the number of bytes to walk between items is just the size of an item. (Increasing this last item would skip items.)

    "## Summary\n",
    "We've previewed some advanced NumPy capabilities, with a focus on _vectorization_; in other words, using clever broadcasting and data windowing techniques to enhance the speed and readability of our calculation code. By making use of vectorization, you can reduce explicit construction of loops in your code, and improve speed of calculation throughout the execution of such code.\n",

    "### What's next\n",
    "This is an advanced NumPy topic; however, it is important to learn this topic in order to design calculation code that maximizes scalability and speed. If you would like to explore this topic further, please review the links below. We also suggest diving into label-based indexing and subsetting with [Pandas](../pandas) and [Xarray](../xarray), where some of this broadcasting can be simplified, or have added context."
